Reg client generates public / private keys:
1) If TPM is enabled while installing reg client downloader docker, these keys are generated inside TPM. If the keys
already exist in TPM, same keys are used, new keys are not generated.

2) If TPM is not enabled, reg client generates public / private keys and stores them in .mosipuser folder. This is
just a simulation.


We need a utlity to generated public/private keys in TPM and pull the public key out. This public key will be manually inserted in the machine_master table.
